# JavaScript Carousel
With a brief search online before creating this JS function, I found out that there are many libraries online and I don't have to reinvent the wheel. However, I wanted to look into ceating a carousel from scratch. Thankfully, I found out John Smilga's tutorials online. But for this carousel, I was getting data from an API. Here were the differences that I faced: 

- I was not dealing with HTML ``` <img> ``` tags, I was actually grabbing data from an API
- That data contained text and icons
- I was dealing with complicated styling using CSS
- I was not using HTML, rather injecting dynamic HTML with JavaScript

This was my second experiment dealing with API data. I have handled data with API before but this was too challenging. I knew math would be involved and I am glad I found some really cool blogs that helped me out with this. For me, this was a monumental task. I feel lighter now that it is working.

For future learning I will be searching more ways to make carousels. I also want to look into any libraries that I can use. There are several online and I will try may be one or two.
